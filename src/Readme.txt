This project demonstrates that any NuGet package can run arbitrary code on your
machine.

> Build the project where the NuGet package was installed and see what happens

Many developers seem to have the false sense that installing NuGet packages
became a "safe" operation after Microsoft dropped support for executing
PowerShell scripts (e.g. `install.ps1`), which is not true.

Installing NuGet packages is (and have always been) a security risk, and you
should only install packages from trusted sources and trusted authors.
